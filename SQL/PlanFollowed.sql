-- Recommended Plan

-- Column Encryption First:
-- Encrypt sensitive columns (e.g., Password, PhoneNumber, Salary) before creating procedures or queries that access these columns.
-- This ensures that all sensitive data is secure from the start.

-- Create Indexes Next:
-- Implement the 10 non-clustered indexes we finalized.
-- This step will optimize data retrieval and ensure faster query performance when we build our stored procedures, views, and UDFs.

-- Define User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
-- Create the top 15 UDFs, focusing on reusable logic and calculations.
-- UDFs will help standardize data processing and simplify complex queries in views and stored procedures.

-- Build Stored Procedures (SPs):
-- Implement the top 25 stored procedures in the priority order we discussed.
-- These procedures will form the backbone of data manipulation and business logic in our application.

-- Create Views:
-- Design and create 5 critical views to support reporting and data visualization.
-- Leverage existing indexes and UDFs for efficient data retrieval.

-- Implement DML Triggers:
-- Define the top 10 triggers, focusing on maintaining data integrity and handling automated actions on DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
-- Ensure that the triggers don’t degrade performance by keeping them optimized.

-- Data Visualization with Power BI/Tableau:
-- Once the above components are in place, integrate the database with Power BI/Tableau.
-- Use the views, stored procedures, and UDFs to generate meaningful insights and dashboards.

-- Why This Plan?
-- Performance: Starting with indexes ensures that all subsequent queries (SPs, views, UDFs) benefit from optimized data retrieval.
-- Security: Encrypting columns first protects sensitive data immediately.
-- Modularity: Building UDFs early allows for code reuse and consistency.
-- Data Integrity: Triggers ensure that data remains consistent during automated operations.
-- User Experience: This flow supports efficient data handling, which is critical for a smooth user experience in Power Apps and fast, responsive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau.
-- Let’s proceed with this plan unless you have any adjustments or specific concerns!
